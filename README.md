# Muzero-data2vec
This project is merging the two pre training algorihtm with the model base algorithm.\
The base game is based on the text adventure game [dream hold](https://eblong.com/zarf/zweb/dreamhold/)\
The papers are https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03555 \
The code base on pytorch\
# Pre requirement knowledge
- Baysien statistics
- Topology
- Linear algebra
- RL machine learning
- NLP machine learing
- Data science
- etc
# Requirement for programming
- Pytroch
- Python
- Numpy
- Panda
- OpenCV
